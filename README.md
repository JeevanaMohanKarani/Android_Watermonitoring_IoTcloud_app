# Android + Firebase IoT LED Control System

This project is an **IoT-based LED control system** where an Android app interacts with an ESP32 simulated on **Wokwi**, using **Firebase Realtime Database** for real-time communication.

---

## Features

- **Real-time LED Control:** Turn LEDs on/off from the Android app or ESP32.
- **Dual Control:** Changes on the app reflect on ESP32 and vice versa.
- **Timer-based Automation:** Schedule LEDs to turn on/off automatically.
- **Wokwi Simulation:** ESP32 simulation for testing without physical hardware.
- **Firebase Integration:** Secure and real-time database syncing.
